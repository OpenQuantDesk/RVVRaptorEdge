## OQDRaptorEdge
Custom Low-Latency Trading Platform on RISC-V with Radeon GPU Acceleration
### Overview

RaptorEdge is a bespoke, ultra-efficient trading system engineered from the ground up using open RISC-V architecture and Radeon GPU acceleration. It features a custom Bloomberg-style hardware keyboard and minimalist Linux OS, offering deterministic performance, full hardware transparency, and trader-optimized workflows for live and research environments.

### System Architecture

Component	Specification
- CPU	RISC-V SoC (e.g., SiFive HiFive Unmatched or similar)
- GPU	AMD Radeon (PCIe) with open-source driver stack (Mesa/ROCm)
- RAM / Storage	≥16GB DDR4, NVMe SSD
- Keyboard	Custom macro keyboard (Bloomberg-style), USB/GPIO connection
- Display	Wayland or direct DRM/GPU-accelerated graphical output
- Networking	Gigabit NIC (optionally FPGA-based for low-latency trading)

### Software Stack

- Realtime Linux Deployment, heavily optimized to the specific architecture
- Lightweight GPU-accelerated interface (Dear ImGui or Qt)
- Support for all major market access mechanisms such as FIX 4.x/5.0, REST, WebSocket, Direct Market Access
- Encrypted logs, biometric login support, hardware ACLs
- Built-in simulation engine with historic data ingestion

### Key Features
- Deterministic latency through full stack control (CPU, GPU, OS, Interface)
- Hardware-accelerated charting and indicator computation
- Custom macro keys for lightning-fast order entry and monitoring
- Plug-and-play modules for strategy scripting and broker adapters
- Ideal for edge deployments, proprietary trading, and quant research
